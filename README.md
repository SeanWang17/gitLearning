# Leaning
This is my first git \
git init #create the hidden folder .git \
git add README.md\
git commit -m "first commit"\
git remote add origin https://github.com/SeanWang17/bv.git  #create the connection between local and remote \
git push -u origin master # upload   everyrhing from local ro remote \
git pull -u origin master # download everything from remote to local \
git clone http... # Another way that straightly download the .git folder and everything from remote to local \
# The connection is inside the .git folder. If you want to create a new git relation, clone the origin and delete .git, create a new one.
